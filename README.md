# ROB311: Artifical Intelligence

This repository is for all the projects I did for an artifical intelligence course I did. In summary, the content of the projects involve algorithms that are used in agent decision making and optimization across varies environments and streams of AI research. There are 5 projects in total, each involving a different topic which more information can be found below. 

## Installation

Each of the projects are already in their compartment folders. To test out a project: download the folders exactly as they are in the repository and keep the files the way they are. It is recommended that you use PyCharm or some other IDE for this. 

### Prerequisites

Here are the libraries that you need to run these projects:

Numpy - A data science and scientific computing library. Source: https://numpy.org/install/

Matplotlib - A graph visualization library. Source: https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html

OpenAI Gym - An RL environment designed by OpenAI. Source: https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v1/

## Usage/Running 

It's simple. Just:

```bash
python program_name.py
```
on the PyCharm or OS terminal to run.

## Projects 

### 1. Graph Search Algorithms
### 2. Inference Constraints and Rubins Vehicle Planning
### 3. Markov Decision Process
### 4. Decision Trees
### 5. RL Algorithms: Q-learning

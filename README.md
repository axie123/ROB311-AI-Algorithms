# ROB311: Artifical Intelligence

This repository is for all the projects I did for an artifical intelligence course I did. In summary, the content of the projects involve algorithms that are used in agent decision making and optimization across varies environments and streams of AI research. There are 5 projects in total, each involving a different topic which more information can be found below. 

## Installation

Each of the projects are already in their compartment folders. To test out a project: download the folders exactly as they are in the repository and keep the files the way they are. It is recommended that you use PyCharm or some other IDE for this. 

### Prerequisites

Here are the libraries that you need to run these projects:

Numpy - A data science and scientific computing library. Source: https://numpy.org/install/

Matplotlib - A graph visualization library. Source: https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html

OpenAI Gym - An RL environment designed by OpenAI. Source: https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v1/

## Usage/Running 

It's simple. Just:

```bash
python program_name.py
```
on the PyCharm or OS terminal to run.

## Projects 

### 1. Graph Search Algorithms

This assignment implements a breadth-first search on a network of facebook users to find a connection between any two users. An A* algorithms search is also implemented
for the same purpose. 

### 2. Inference Constraints and Dubins Vehicle Planning

An inference deduction algorithm is developed. RRT Dubins planning was used to help a virtual agent find the shortest path to an objective around an obstacle. 

### 3. Markov Decision Process

A Markov decision process algorithm was written to determine the probabilities of successive states and possible terminal states.

### 4. Decision Trees (DTs)

A DT was created and an adversial game agent is created as well.

### 5. RL Algorithms: Q-learning

Q-learning was used to optimize the training time of an agent in OpenAI's Gym environment. The goal of the agent is to balance a pole for a certain amount of time.
